# WL Data Visualisations

These are p5.js demos to work out the structure of our graph algorithums... hopefully.

To see the demo, just open the relevant index.html file in a browser (note this is an aid for development, so cross browser support is not a concern here - use chrome).

Details for each are in the code.
